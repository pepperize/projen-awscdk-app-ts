# Projen awscdk-construct

This project provides a projen project type providing presets for an AWS CDK construct library project.

## Getting started

To create a new project, run the following command and follow the instructions:

```shell
mkdir my-project
cd my-project
git init -b main
npx projen new --from @pepperize/projen-awscdk-construct
```

_If your git cli doesn't have a `-b` option, either update [git](https://git-scm.com/) or issue `git init && git checkout -b main`._

## Usage

To init a new project from this module:

```shell
npx projen new --from @pepperize/projen-awscdk-construct
```

## Create a new projen project type

1. Create a new project for the projen external jsii npm module
   ```shell
   mkdir my-project
   cd my-project
   git init -b main
   npx projen new jsii
   ```
2. Your `src/index.ts` should export only one project.
